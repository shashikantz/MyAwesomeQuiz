Consider the following statements:
1. Agricultural soils release nitrogen oxides into environment.
2. Cattle release ammonia into environment.
3. Poultry industry releases reactive nitrogen compounds into environment.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3
Correct Option: D
Explanation:
Statement 1 is correct:
Nitrous oxide is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of biomass burning, and biological
processes in soils. Biomass burning is not only an instantaneous source of nitrous oxide, but it 
results in a longer term enhancement of the biogenic production of this gas.
The current belief is that 90% of the emissions come from soils. Nitrous oxide is formed in soils 
during the microbiological processes nitrification and denitrification. Because nitrous oxide is a 
gas it can escape from soil during these transformations. Nitrous oxide production is controlled by 
temperature, pH, water holding capacity of the soil, irrigation practices, fertilizer rate, tillage 
practice, soil type, oxygen concentration, availability of carbon, vegetation, land use practices 
and use of chemicals. Nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils are increased by the addition 
of fertilizer.
Statement 2 is correct:
Cattle release both ammonia and methane into the atmosphere. Ruminant animals do not efficiently 
utilize dietary nitrogen. Excess nitrogen fed in the form of feed proteins is excreted in manure 
(urine + feces). Dairy cows on average secrete in milk 25 to 35 percent of the nitrogen they 
consume and almost all the remaining nitrogen is excreted in urine and feces with about half of the 
nitrogen excreted in urine.
Statement 3 is correct:
Nitrogen emissions in chicken production occur in several forms but mainly ammonia can contribute 
directly or indirectly to several environmental and public health hazards. Chicken production also 
contributes to some extent to climate change through the emissions of nitrous oxide, fine 
particulate matters, and methane.

What is common to the places known as Aliyar, Isapur and Kangsabati?
(a) Recently discovered uranium deposits
(b) Tropical rain forests
(c) Underground cave systems
(d) Water reservoirs
Correct Option: D
Explanation:
*  These are water reservoirs of national importance.
•  Aliyar Dam: Aliyar Dam is a charming location surrounded by Annamali Hills with wonderful 
natural views. It is located between Pollachi and Valparai.At a distance of 64 Kms from Coimbatore, 
24 Kms from Pollachi & 545 Kms from Chennai.Built across Aliyar River between 1959 and 1969, the 
primary purpose of the dam is to support irrigation for Pollachi and nearby places for Agriculture 
purpose. The height of the dam is 81 meters. There is a well-maintained park built at bottom of the 
Dam. The view of the Anamalai range around the reservoir is a feast for the eyes and the view of 
the coconut groves from top of the dam is amazing. Boating is available here.
•   Isapur Dam: Isapur Dam is one of the biggest dam in the state of Maharashtra, build over the 
Painganga River that divides Maharashtra into two regions namely; Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. 
It is an earth fil1 dam, with a height of 57 m, and the length is 4,120.1 m. The motive behind the 
construction of the Dam was mainly irrigation. Lush with water, Isapur Dam is a prominent tourist 
attraction cradled in the lap of mother nature. Blessed with pristine scenery, it is an incredible 
place for the keen bird watchers to stay around and get mesmerized by the sweet calls of the 
colorful birds around, especially during winters. While the immense greenery around the dam makes 
it a perfect background for the picnic or sightseeing.
•   Kangsabati Reservoir Project: Kangsabati Reservoir Project was started in the year 1956-57. 
Till date an irrigation potential of 3,48,477 ha. has been created in the districts of Bankura, 
Midnapore and Hooghly through this Project. With bank assistance and under Accelerated Irrigation 
Benefit Programme, the Government has undertaken large extension and improvement programme of the 
main canals. The project though originally planned for Kharif and limited Rabi, at present the 
irrigation water is provided for Boro cultivation also to an area of 27,944 ha.

In the context of proposals to the use of hydrogen-enriched CNG (H-CNG) as fuel for buses in public transport, consider the following statements:
1.  The main advantage of the use of H-CNG is the elimination of carbon monoxide emissions.
2. H-CNG as fuel reduces carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon emissions.
3.  Hydrogen up to one-fifth by volume can be blended with CNG as fuel for buses.
4. H-CNG makes the fuel less expensive than CNG.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Correct Option: B
Explanation:
*  Statement 1 is incorrect: H-CNG reduces the emission of Carbon Monoxide up to 70% but does not 
eliminate it.
*   Statement 2 is correct: H-CNG as a fuel reduces the emission of carbon-di-oxide and hydrocarbon 
as compared to other fuels. Compared with natural gas, HCNG has many advantages when it comes to 
performance. Research has shown that the brake effective thermal efficiency increases with an 
increased percentage of hydrogen. Another effect of the addition of hydrogen is that the brake 
specific fuel consumption is reduced, the cycle by cycle variations are also reduced, and the 
thermal efficiency is increased.
G      Emissions can also be improved with the addition of hydrogen. Compared to pure natural gas, 
HCNG reduces the HC emissions, which is in part due to the increased combustion stability that 
comes with the addition of hydrogen. However, due to the increased temperature and combustion 
duration that accompanies the hydrogen addition, an increase in NOx emissions is observed.
*   Statement 3 is correct: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is methane (CH4) stored at high pressure. 
CNG as a fuel can be used in place of gasoline, diesel fuel and propane (C3H8) / LPG  and its 
combustion produces fewer undesirable gases then the other mentioned fuels. Combustion is a high 
temperature exothermic chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant that produces oxidized 
products. When 18-20% of hydrogen as fuel is mixed into the CNG it becomes pollution free as it reduces the emission
of carbon-monoxide up to 20%.
*   Statement 4 is incorrect: Current cost of H2 is more than the cost of Natural Gas. Therefore, 
HCNG's cost is more than CNG. Current price of HCNG is higher than CNG and will cost 72 paisa per 
kilometer more if implemented in DTC buses.

Why are dewdrops riot formed on a cloudy night?
(a) Clouds absorb the radiation released from the Earth's surface.
(b) Clouds reflect back the Earth's radiation.
(c) The Earth's surface would have low temperature on cloudy nights.
(d) Clouds deflect the blowing wind to ground level.
Correct Option: B
Explanation:
Dew: Dew is the water droplets formed by condensation of water vapor on a relatively cold surface 
of an object. It forms when the temperature of an object drops below the dew point temperature.
When there is cloudy weather condition, terrestrial radiation is radiated back to the earth's 
surface after reflection from clouds. This leads to formation of hothouse (Greenhouse) condition 
due to which temperature on earth's surface is relatively higher. Hence, condition becomes 
unfavorable for the formation of dew.

Jagirdar and Zamindar
*   The Jagirdars were the king's officials who enjoyed the land gifted from the King. They were 
the rank (mansab) holder given by the king called mansabdar.
*   Statement 2 is incorrect: They were allotted non-inheritable land area equivalent to their fee 
amount called Jagir. These Jagirs are temporary in character and the Jagirdars only have the right 
to claim and enjoy the revenue collected from the land.
The holder of land is termed as the Zamindar. They had the hereditary right over the land to claim 
share in the peasant's output other than land revenues.
They also have the right to detain the peasants. In most of the Mughal period the Zamindar 
collected land revenue from the actual tillers of land and for this they were allowed one tenth of 
the collections either in cash or an equivalent amount of tax free land.
*   Statement l is correct: Jagirdars were holders of land assignments in lieu of judicial and 
police duties, whereas Zamindars were holders of revenue rights without obligation to perform any 
duty other than revenue collection.

(a) poverty rates vary from State to State
(b) price levels vary from State to State
(c) Gross State Product varies from State to State
(d) quality of public distribution varies from State to State
Correct Option: B
Explanation:
Poverty Line
*   There are many challenges in marking a poverty line, such as determining components of poverty 
line basket.
 There are price differentials (of constituents of basket) which vary
from state to state and period to period. So, in a given year in India, official poverty lines are 
higher in some States than in others because price levels vary from State to State
*   Further, consumption patterns, nutritional needs and prices of components keep on changing as

In the context of which of the following do some scientists suggest the use of cirrus cloud thinning technique and the injection of sulphate aerosol into stratosphere?
(a) Creating the artificial rains in some regions
(b) Reducing the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones
(c) Reducing the adverse effects of solar wind on the Earth
(d) Reducing the global warming
Correct Option: D
Explanation:
*   Cirrus clouds do not reflect a lot of solar radiation back into space, but because they form at 
high altitudes and cold temperatures, they trap long-wave radiation and have a climate impact 
similar to greenhouse gases. Thus Thinning cirrus clouds would reduce the absorption of infrared 
radiation and proposed form of climate engineering to reduce global warming.
*   Another proposed Geo-engineering technique involves injecting reflective sulfate aerosol 
particles into Earth's lower stratosphere to cast a small proportion of the inbound sunlight back 
into space and cool the planet off. Thus both are climate engineering/ Geo-engineering techniques 
to reduce global warming.

(b) They are considered to cause skin cancer in children.
(c) They are small enough to be absorbed by crop plants in irrigated fields.
(d) They are often found to be used as food adulterants.
Correct Option: A
Explanation:
      Microbeads are itty-bitty plastic orbs that can be found in exfoliating facial scrubs,
cosmetics, shower gels and toothpaste, among other products. They are part of a larger class of 
microplastics, or pieces of plastic less than five millimeters, or 0.2 inch, long.
      Microbeads that wash down drains cannot be filtered out by many wastewater treatment plants,
meaning that tiny plastics slip easily into waterways. Fish and other marine animals often eat 
them, introducing potentially toxic substances into the food chain. Thus they are harmful to marine 
ecosystem.

The word 'Denisovan' is sometimes mentioned in media in reference to
(a) fossils of a kind of dinosaurs
(b) an early human species
(c) a cave system found in North-East India
(d) a geological period in the history of Indian subcontinent
Correct Option: B
Explanation:
Denisovans is early human species. When our ancestors first migrated out of Africa around 60,000 
years ago, they were not alone. At least two of our hominid cousins had made the same 
journey—Neanderthals and Denisovans. Neanderthals, the better known of the two species, left Africa 
about 300,000 years ago and settled in Europe and parts of western Asia. The Denisovans are a much 
more recent addition to the human family tree. In 2008, paleoanthropologists digging in a cave in 
southern Siberia unearthed a 40,000-year-old adult tooth and an exquisitely preserved fossilized 
pinkie bone that had belonged to a young girl who was between five and seven years old when she 
died.

Consider the following statements: A digital signature is
1. an electronic record that identifies the certifying authority issuing it
2.  used to serve as a proof of identity of an individual to access information or server on Internet
3.  an electronic method of signing an electronic document and ensuring that the original content is unchanged
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3
Correct Option: C
Explanation:
*   A digital signature is basically a way to ensure that an electronic document (e-mail, 
spreadsheet, text file, etc.) is authentic. Authentic means that you know who created the document 
and you know that it has not been altered in any way since that person created it. Thus statement 3 is correct.
       Digital signatures are not to be confused with digital certificates. A digital certificate,
an electronic document that contains the digital signature of the issuing certificate authority, 
binds together a public key with an identity and can be used to verify that a public key belongs to 
a particular person or entity. Thus statement 1 is incorrect.
      Digital signature also not used to serve as proof of identity of an individual to access
information or server on internet thus statement 2 is also incorrect.

trials.

Recently, scientists observed the merger of giant 'blackholes' billions of light-years away from the Earth. What is the significance of this observation?
(a) 'Higgs boson particles' were detected.
(b) 'Gravitational waves' were detected.
(c) Possibility of inter-galactic space travel through 'wormhole' was confirmed.
(d) It enabled the scientists to understand 'singularity'.
Correct Option: B
Explanation:
*   Billions of light years away, two black holes have collided to create a larger one — the 
biggest black hole merger yet detected. It has a mass more than 80 times that of the sun. The 
resulting energy injected into the fabric of space-time was also record breaking, with five sun's 
worth of mass released in the form gravitational waves as the two holes spiralled in towards each 
other. Such titanic amounts of energy meant that the signal was still detectable by the time it 
reached gravitational wave detectors on Earth. It produced a record-breaking result — the most 
distant collision detected so far, nine billion light years away.

each member state no longer needs to write its own data protection laws and laws are consistent 
across the entire EU. In addition to EU members, it is important to note that any company that 
markets goods or services to EU residents, regardless of its location, is subject to the 
regulation. As a result, GDPR will have an impact on data protection requirements globally.

With  reference  to communication  technologies,  what  is/are  the  difference/ differences between LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and VoLTE (Voice over Long-Term Evolution)?
1. LTE is commonly marketed as 3G and VoLTE is commonly marketed as advanced 3G.
2. LTE is data-only technology and VoLTE is voice-only technology.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2
Correct Option: D
Explanation:
LTE and VoLTE
*  Statement 1 is incorrect: VoLTE stands for voice over LTE. It's voice calls over a 4G LTE 
network, rather than the 2G or 3G connections which are usually used.
*   VoLTE is a technology update to the LTE protocol used by mobile phone networks. Under LTE, the 
infrastructure of telecom players only allows transmission of data while voice calls are routed to 
their older 2G or 3G networks. This is why, under LTE, you cannot access your 4G data services 
while on a call. This leads to problems such as slow internet speeds and poor voice clarity.
*   VoLTE allows voice calls to be 'packaged' and carried through LTE networks. This would mean 4G 
data accessibility even during calls. VoLTE is an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
specification which enables a variety of services to operate seamlessly on the network rather than 
having to switch to different applications for voice or video
*   Statement 2 is incorrect: In LTE, the network will switch off the data connection while making 
voice calls, while you don't need to turn your data connection off while making a voice call in 
VoLTE. While LTE is targeted for increasing data rates on the 4G bandwidth, VoLTE is targeted 
towards both voice calling and internet data without affecting each other.
