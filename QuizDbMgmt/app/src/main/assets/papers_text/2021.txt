And, Option (b) is correct.

At the national level, which ministry is nodal agency to ensure effective implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006?
(a) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
(b) Ministry of Panchayati Raj
(c) Ministry of Rural Development
(d) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 recognizes the rights of the forest dwelling tribal communities and other traditional forest dwellers to forest resources, on which these communities were dependent for a variety of needs, including livelihood, habitation and other socio-cultural needs. The forest management policies, including the Acts, Rules and Forest Policies of Participatory Forest Management policies in both colonial and post-colonial India, did not, till the enactment of this Act, recognize the symbiotic relationship of the STs with the forests, re flected in their dependence on the forest as well as in their traditional wisdom regarding conservation of the forests.
The Ministry of the Central Government dealing with Tribal Affairs or any officer or authority authorised by the Central Government on this behalf shall be the nodal agency for the implementation of the provisions of this Act. Hence, option (d) is correct.

A legislation which confers on the executive or administrative authority an unguided and uncontrolled discretionary power in the matter of application of law violates which one of the following articles of the Constitution of India?
(a) Article 14
(b) Article 28
(c) Article 32
(d) Article 44
Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
The court exercises control over delegation of discretionary powers to the administration by adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the law under which such powers are delegated with reference to the fundamental rights enunciated in Part III of the Indian Constitution. Therefore, if the law confers vague and wide discretionary power on any administrative authority, it may be declared ultra vires Article 14, Article 19 and other provisions of the Constitution.
Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees equality before law but the courts have permitted reasonable classification to be made. Where the law is valid under the article, a discriminatory action would still be violative of the equality clause.
Hence, option (a) is correct.
Also, by elimination, Art. 28, and Art.44 are unrelated to the question and Art. 44 is to protect the FR of the citizens.

Which one of the following in Indian polity is an essential feature that indicates that it is federal in character?
(a) The independence of judiciary is safeguarded.
(b) The Union Legislature has elected representatives from constituent units.
(c) The Union Cabinet can have elected representatives from regional parties.
(d) The Fundamental Rights are enforceable by Courts of Law
Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own jurisdiction in specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration.
The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed.
The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government.
Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers. The most important feature of the federal system adopted by the Indian Constitution is the principle that relations between the States and the centre would be based on cooperation. And for this, Independent Judiciary is the prerequisite. Hence, Option (a) is correct.

Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 and 3
(b) 1, 2 and 4
(c) 4 only
(d) 2 and 3
Correct Option: (b)
Explanation:
Permaculture is, amongst others, an approach to land management that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems thinking. It uses these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, rewilding, and community resilience.
Permaculture discourages monoculture and serves to open up the possibility of growing a wide range of food grains, fruits and vegetables and thereby expanding the food basket; thus permaculture also contributes to community health. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Application of permaculture methods and introducing permaculture techniques like swales, natural mulching, rainfall harvesting, legume cultivation, have a clear role in improving soil properties, increasing soil organic matter content and reducing soil salinity. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Due to its focus on water conservation and region specific crops, it is very much suitable for arid and semi arid regions. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.
Mulch is a material placed on the soil surface to maintain moisture, reduce weed growth, mitigate soil erosion and improve soil conditions. Mulching can help to improve crop yield and optimise water use which is an essential component of permaculture.
Hence, statement 4 is correct.

Originally, exploration activities were predominantly undertaken by national agencies, until 2010, when private companies became involved and a polymetallic-nodule-mining industry was born.
Statement 2 is correct: India's exclusive rights to explore polymetallic nodules from seabed in the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) have been extended byfive years. These rights are over 75000 sq. km of area in international waters allocated by the International Seabed Authority for developmental activities for polymetallic nodules.
Statement 3 is correct: In 1972, a young ecologist named Hjalmar Thiel ventured to a remote part of the Pacific Ocean known as the Clarion–Clipperton Zone (CCZ). The sea floor there boasts one of the world's largest untapped collections of rare-earth elements. Some 4,000 meters below the ocean surface, the abyssal ooze of the CCZ holds trillions of polymetallic nodules — potato-sized deposits loaded with copper, nickel, manganese, and other precious ores.

Among the following, which one is the least water-efficient crop?
(a) Sugarcane
(b) Sunflower
(c) Pearl millet
(d) Red gram
Correct Option: (a)
Explanation:
It takes about 210 litres of water to produce 1 kg of sugar cane.  Water footprint of sunflower is 7– 9 litre per kg. Millets are sown in dry areas with minimal irrigation.  Red gram requires 35 to 40 cm water, during its entire growth period. Optimum moisture is required during budding, flowering, and pod formation stages. As Red gram is a rain-fed crop grown in assured rainfall areas, usually it does not need any irrigation. Hence option (a) is the correct answer.

Consider the following statements:38.
1. In the tropical zone, the western sections of the oceans are warmer than the eastern sections owing to the influence of trade winds.
2. In the temperate zone, westerlies make the eastern sections of oceans warmer than the western sections.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2
Correct Option: (c)
Explanation:
Mid-ocean surface temperatures vary with latitude in response to the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation. There is an excess of incoming solar radiation at latitudes less than approximately 45° and an excess of radiation loss at latitudes higher than approximately 45°.  The northward displacement of warm water to higher latitudes by the Gulf Stream of the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio (Japan Current) of the North Pacific creates sharp changes in temperature along the current boundaries or thermal fronts, where these northward-moving flows meet colder water flowing southward from higher latitudes.  At low latitudes the trade winds act to move water away from the lee coasts of the landmasses to produce areas of coastal upwelling of water from depth and reduce surface temperatures.
Hence option (c) is correct.

“Leaf litter decomposes faster than in any other biome and as a result the soil surface is often almost bare. Apart from trees, the vegetation is largely composed of plant forms that reach up into the canopy vicariously, by climbing the trees or growing as epiphytes, rooted on the upper branches of trees”. This is the most likely description of
(a) coniferous forest
(b) dry deciduous forest
(c) mangrove forest
(d) tropical rain forest
Correct Option: (d)
Explanation:
The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome where it rains all year long. It is known for its dense canopies of vegetation that form three different layers. The top layer or canopy contains giant trees that grow to heights of 75 m (about 250 ft) or more. This layer of vegetation prevents much of the sunlight from reaching the ground. Thick, woody vines are also found in the canopy. They climb trees in the canopy to reach for sunlight. The middle layer, or understory, is made up of vines, smaller trees, ferns, and palms.  A large number of plants from this level are used as common houseplants. Because of the small amount of sunlight and rainfall these plants receive, they adapt easily to home environments. The bottom layer or floor of the rainforest is covered with wet leaves and leaf litter. This material decomposes rapidly in the wet, warm conditions (like a compost pile) sending nutrients back into the soil. Few plants are found on the floor of the forest due to the lack of sunlight.

Article 300A directs that - Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law.—No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.

exports relatively less expensive for foreigners. Second, the devaluation makes foreign products
relatively more expensive for domestic consumers, thus discouraging imports. This may help to
increase the country's exports and decrease imports, and may therefore help to reduce the current
account deficit.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Explanation:
The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh. It was approved at the 1999 UNESCO General Conference and has been observed throughout the world since
2000. It is celebrated on 21 Feb each year. So, statement 1 is correct.
In Bangladesh, 21 February is the anniversary of the day when the people of Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) fought for recognition for the Bangla language.  In 1948, the then Government of Pakistan declared Urdu to be the sole national language of Pakistan, even though Bengali or Bangla was spoken by the majority of people combining East Pakistan and West Pakistan. The East Pakistan people protested, and demanded that Bangla to be at least one of the national languages, in addition to Urdu.
The demand was raised first by Dhirendranath Datta from East Pakistan on 23 February 1948, in the constituent Assembly of Pakistan. So, Statement 2 is also correct.
To demolish the protest, the government of Pakistan outlawed public meeting and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka, with the support of the general public, arranged massive rallies and meetings.
On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on rallies. Abdus Salam, Abul Barkat, Ra fiq Uddin Ahmed, Abdul Jabbar and Sha fiur Rahman died, with hundreds of others injured. This was a rare incident in history, where people sacrificed their lives for their mother tongue.
Since then, Bangladeshis have celebrated the International Mother Language Day as one of their tragic days.
Hence, option (c) is correct.

1. Mitakshara was the civil law for upper castes and Dayabhaga was the civil law for lower castes.

3. The Mitakshara system deals with the matters related to the property held by male members only of a family, whereas the Dayabhaga system deals with the matters related to the property held by both male and female members of a family.
Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only
Correct Option: (b)
Explanation:
The Dayabhaga and The Mitakshara are the two schools of law that govern the law of succession of the Hindu Undivided Family Under Indian Law.  According to the Mitakshara law school a joint family refers only to the male member of a family and extends to include his son, grandson and great-grandson. They collectively have co-ownership/ Coparcenary in the Joint Family. Thus, a son by birth acquires an interest in the ancestral property of the joint family. Under the Dayabhaga law school, the son has no automatic ownership right by birth but acquires it on the demise of his father.
In the Mitakshara system the wife cannot demand partition. She, however, has the right to a share in any partition effected between her husband and her sons. Under the Dayabhaga this right does not exist for the women because the sons cannot demand partition as the father is the absolute owner. In both the systems, in any partition among the sons, the mother is entitled to a share equal to that of a son. Similarly, when a son dies before partition leaving the mother as his heir, the mother is entitled to a share of her deceased son as well as share in her own right when there is a partition between the remaining sons.
